 * Creates a Ktor [Logger] that logs request and response details in a compact format.
 *
 * It buffers log messages and flushes them when a "REQUEST:" or "RESPONSE:" line is encountered.
 * This helps to group related log entries together.
 *
 * For example, a typical log output might look like:
 * ```
 * REQUEST: https://api.example.com/data | METHOD: GET
 * RESPONSE: 200 OK | BODY: {"key": "value"}
 * ```
 * Instead of multiple individual lines for headers, body, etc.
 *
 * It uses `co.touchlab.kermit.Logger` with the tag "Volyum" for actual logging.
